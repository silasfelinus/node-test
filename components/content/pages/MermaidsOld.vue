        Mermaids of Venice is a polytheistic love story with rhyming couplets at the start of each chapter. It features
        an attractive cover, perfect for adorning a coffee table or complementing a reader's face. It is also,
        unfortunately, not without its flaws

          <strong>Overuse of $5 words:</strong> The narrative is laden with saccharine sesquipedalians, a deliberate
          choice to convince readers that the author was "VeRY SmaRt."

          <strong>Breaking character arc conventions:</strong> The first act ends with the abrupt death of the main
          character, a significant deviation from traditional rules for character arcs.

          <strong>Use of the magical negro trope:</strong> Despite the affection for the character Hermes, the book

        I'm proud that my third act foreshadowed the Occupy Wall Street movement, but after #BLM, #MeToo, and raising
        two boy-children during extended quarantine, any modification to "Mermaids of Venice" stinks of revisionism.

        "Mermaids" was conceived as a force for good, but time has reshaped my perception of what constitutes "good."
